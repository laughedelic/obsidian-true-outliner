 * - 'all' — every eligible kind's first line (status quo).
 * - 'with-children' — only nodes that actually have at least one child.
 *   Atom kinds are leaves by construction, so this always excludes them.
 * - 'headings-and-paragraphs' — only the two kinds that CAN ever have
 *   children in this tree model, regardless of whether a given instance

 * `PluginData` stays a single, complete description of what is persisted.
 *
 * Two independent axes rather than one combined setting: guides answer "how did
 * I get here" and markers answer "where am I", and the useful combinations
 * cross them. `markers: 'lineage'` with `guides: 'off'` is the only rendering
 * that says anything inside a pure list, where no guide column exists at all.
 * Each axis is a three-state enum rather than a pair of toggles, so its own two
 * renderings can never double up on the same level.
